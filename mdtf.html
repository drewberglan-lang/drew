                My name is Drew Testerman and I am a jounrnalism student at the University of Oklahoma. Growing up in Norman, I have gained a love for this University and its sports that is almost unmatched to anything else in my life. Of course, due to my limiting physical stature, playing for those teams was a dream squashed very early in my life. Now, I am focused on the second best thing... writing and talking about those teams!

                The Thunder are also really good at basketball. Easily one of the best teams I have watched with my own two eyes, all led by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. He is the best player I have ever seen. HANDS DOWN. No one can stop him, and he is about to win his second MVP in a row, break a Wilt Chamberlain record, win the title again, and secure himself as an all-time great.
